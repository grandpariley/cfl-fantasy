How to add another way to pick players:

1) Add a class in `pkg.model` using either of the abstract classes provided: `SimpleModel` or `Model`
2) Add the model to the registry in `pkg.model.registry`

You can run all models with `python3 main.py` or a specific model with `python3 main.py model_name`. List all models with `python3 main.py list`.
